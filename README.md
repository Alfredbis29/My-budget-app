# Ruby on Rails - Budget Tracker

> This section offers the Rails Budget Tracker web app, which allows you to track your expenditures. The software allows you to track your transactions by category as well as your overall costs. Once logged in, you may add a list of categories you want to track and then add transactions under those categories. Each category has its own symbol that helps you see your costs.
